Algorithms for ritual names:

1) some formula, eg: consonant, vowel, Consonant, vowel, double consonant, vowel, consonant

2) Each icon has an associated syllable.  The full ritual word is composed of the multiple syllables

eg: 
Triangle:  tri
Square: ska
Pentagon: pen
Hexagon: hex
Circle: cir
Wine Glass: win

So, Triangle, Wine Glass, Hexagon, Circle would be: Triwinhexcir
Wine Glass, Square, Pentagon, Square would be: Winskapenska


Or something completely unrelated (and harder to learn):

Triangle:  kan
Square: tor
Pentagon: rel
Hexagon: man
Circle: dor
Wine Glass: zam

So, Triangle, Wine Glass, Hexagon, Circle would be: Kanzammandor
Wine Glass, Square, Pentagon, Square would be: Zamtorreltor

If we keep this as a constant, players would get better by learning the associated syllables
